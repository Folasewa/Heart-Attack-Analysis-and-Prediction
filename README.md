# Heart-Attack-Analysis-and-Prediction
Predict the possibility of getting heart attack 
This Project is a classification problem hence classification algorithms like logistic regression, decision tree classifier or random forest classifier can be used.
Data cleaning was not done since there were no missing values and the data wasn't dirty.
Exploratory Data Analysis was done on the dataset to check how the different health parameters relate to possibility of getting heart attack.
I noticed an imbalance and decided to balance the data using oversampling however after applying oversampling, the imbalance target data was reversed.
Preprocessing starts and label encoder was used in encoding categorical dataset.
Comparison of the three classifiers was done and Decision tress classifier was used as my classifier algorithm.
Splitting of the data into training and testing datasets and prediction follows.
